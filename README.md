# System Threat Forecaster Project

## Overview
As part of the Malware Prediction Competition, I developed the **System Threat Forecaster** project (Aug 2024 – Nov 2024) to predict a system’s probability of malware infection based on telemetry data generated by antivirus software. The competition aimed to leverage system properties to forecast malware presence, and my solution achieved a notable ranking.

## Competition Context
The Malware Prediction Competition challenged participants to predict whether a system, identified by a unique `MachineID`, was infected with malware (`target` = 1) or not (`target` = 0) using data from `train.csv` and applying predictions to `test.csv`. The dataset included 62.22 MB of CSV files with features like antivirus product details, OS versions, hardware specifications, and more. Submissions were evaluated using `accuracy_score()`.

## Project Details
- **Duration**: August 2024 – November 2024
- **Objective**: Predict malware infection probability for systems based on telemetry data.
- **Approach**:
  - Engineered **17 features** from **99,835 system records** in the training dataset, focusing on key system properties such as `EngineVersion`, `RealTimeProtectionState`, `ProcessorCoreCount`, and `DateAS`.
  - Utilized an optimized **XGBoost** model to handle the complex, high-dimensional dataset.
  - Applied feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
- **Results**:
  - Achieved **63.87% accuracy** on the competition’s test set.
  - Ranked in the **top 8.7%** among **1,519 participants** on the Kaggle leaderboard.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, XGBoost, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Kaggle

## Dataset Highlights
- **Files**:
  - `train.csv`: Training data with system properties and `target` labels.
  - `test.csv`: Test data for predictions.
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Template for submission format.
- **Key Features**:
  - `MachineID`: Unique system identifier.
  - `ProductName`, `EngineVersion`, `AppVersion`: Antivirus software details.
  - `HasTpm`, `IsSecureBootEnabled`: Hardware security features.
  - `PrimaryDiskCapacityMB`, `TotalPhysicalRAMMB`: System hardware specs.
  - `DateAS`, `DateOS`: Timestamps for malware signatures and OS updates.
- **Target Distribution**: Approximately balanced, with 4,995 systems labeled `0` and 5,005 labeled `1` in the sample submission.

## Achievements
- **Top 8.7% Ranking**: Secured a competitive position among 1,519 participants, demonstrating effective feature engineering and model optimization.
- **Practical Impact**: Developed a robust pipeline for processing large-scale telemetry data, applicable to real-world cybersecurity threat detection.
